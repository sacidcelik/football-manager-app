# React Football Manager App and API

This React app lets you add a player via a form to the database. The implementation with MognoDB (Atlas) lets the players persist until you edit or delete them. There are different views, as well as a first (rudimentary) shopping cart feature.

## Installation

After cloning this repository, simply run `npm install` in the main directory â€“ this will also install all dependencies of the `client` and the Express `server`.

## Run in development mode

Start the app in development mode by entering `npm run dev`.

Make sure your MongoDB is up and running

## Enjoy!
